Remington manufactured prototypes of Keene's patents for consideration by the United States Army Ordnance Department Magazine Gun Board convened in 1878. Although the Army rejected the design in favor of the Winchester-Hotchkiss, Remington commenced production and offered the rifle to the United States Navy Bureau of Ordnance. The Navy purchased 250 rifles for comparison with their 2,500 Hotchkiss rifles and 300 M1885 Remington-Lee rifles. The Remington-Keene rifles were delivered in 1880 with US and an anchor stamped on the left side of the barrel and WWK and P (proof) stamped on the right side of the barrel by Lieutenant William W. Kimball. These rifles remained in service for less than a decade aboard USS Trenton (1876) and USS Michigan (1843). In July 1880 the United States Department of the Interior purchased 600 Frontier Model carbines with 24 in (61 cm) barrels to arm the Indian Police on a number of reservations in the western United States. Rifles were manufactured for civilian sales chambered for .45-70, .60-40, and .43 Spanish.                                                                          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington-Keene_rifle

It was officially adopted as a United States military bolt-action rifle on June 19, 1903, and saw service in World War I. It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing semi-automatic 8 round M1 Garand starting in 1937. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle during World War II, the Korean War, and even in the early stages of the Vietnam War. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, and as a military drill rifle.                                   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1903_Springfield_rifle

It is derived from the M24 Sniper Weapon System and is intended to replace existing M24s. After winning a competitive bidding process, Remington was awarded the production contract. Up to 3,600 weapons will be procured. The Army had anticipated fielding upgraded weapons to deployed U.S. Army Snipers near the end of December 2010. Later project manager for Soldier weapons Colonel Douglas Tamilio said the XM2010 expected fielding will happen in January 2011.                                           The XM2010 system differs from the prior M24 Sniper Rifle in that the XM2010 fires .300 Winchester Magnum ammunition to provide approximately 50% additional effective range relative to the M24's 7.62x51mm NATO. This chambering to dimensionally larger cartridges is possible because the M24 was designed to use the "long-action" version of the Remington 700 receiver. The U.S. Army hopes that the additional effective range helps their snipers in engagements in mountainous and desert terrain in which the War in Afghanistan is fought.The general penalties for using bigger, more powerful magnum rifle ammunition compared to smaller, non-magnum standard rifle cartridges are increases in recoil, jump, flash, weight, and barrel wear.
